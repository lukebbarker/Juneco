## Installation

### Node

If you don't know what node is, or how to use it, no problem! If you're using your mac, follow these steps.

1. Open Applications / Utilities / Terminal, it's on every mac
2. Type `node -v` into the window that pops up
3. If there is a big error looking thing, or if the number is less than 6.x.x or something...
4. run `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash`
5. that should work smoothly, if it doesn't email me
6. otherwise drag the folder to the terminal in your dock, and it should open to that folder => press enter
7. then copy and paste `npm install`
